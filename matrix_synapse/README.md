**Full Matrix homeserver stack — Synapse + Element Web + Element Call (Voice/Video) + Ketesa — as a single Home Assistant Add-on.**

**Fork:** `Yskaa91/ha-apps` (`swag` branch), based on `pol4rfuchs/ha-apps`. Frontends default to the `Yskaa91/element-web` and `Yskaa91/element-call` swag releases; upstream `element-hq/*` remains available.

## 🧩 What's included

| Component | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Synapse** | pip floor, Renovate-tracked | Matrix homeserver |
| **PostgreSQL 15** | Debian pkg | Database |
| **Element Web** | swag fork latest by default (auto-fetched, version-tracked; upstream selectable) | Web client |
| **Element Call** | swag fork latest by default (auto-fetched, version-tracked; upstream selectable) | Voice / Video calls |
| **LiveKit SFU** | `livekit/livekit` latest (auto-fetched, version-tracked) | WebRTC media server |
| **Ketesa** (formerly Synapse Admin) | `etkecc/ketesa` latest (auto-fetched, version-tracked) | Admin UI |
| **S6-Overlay** | — | Multi-service init |
| **Bundled in Element Call swag** | — | Discord-like theme, Reactions soundboard, DeepFilterNet3 default denoiser, GTCRN option |

> ℹ️ The admin UI is [Ketesa](https://github.com/etkecc/ketesa) — the etke.cc project formerly known as Synapse Admin, renamed in 2026. It's a drop-in replacement of the original Awesome-Technologies fork, with wider Synapse compatibility and active maintenance. Element Web, Element Call, and Ketesa are downloaded at first start and re-checked against the selected source's `latest` on every subsequent start — no manual updates needed.
>
> ℹ️ Synapse itself works differently: it's `pip install`ed at **Docker build time**, not fetched at container start. A new Synapse release only lands once the image is rebuilt — Renovate opens a PR when a new PyPI release appears, and merging it triggers that rebuild.

## 🧬 Fork organization & dependencies

This add-on is one of three coordinated forks under the GitHub user **Yskaa91**:

| Repo | Role | Upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `Yskaa91/ha-apps` | This Home Assistant add-on (`matrix_synapse`) | `pol4rfuchs/ha-apps` |
| `Yskaa91/element-web` | Element Web fork: sampled dark-cyan theme and widget wiring | `element-hq/element-web` |
| `Yskaa91/element-call` | Element Call fork: Reactions soundboard, DeepFilterNet3 default denoiser, GTCRN option | `element-hq/element-call` |

Each fork keeps an `upstream` remote and develops on a `swag` branch pinned to an upstream tag. Fork releases use `swag` tags: Element Web `v1.12.30-swag.<n>`, Element Call `v0.26.1-swag.<n>`, this add-on `1.8.3-swag`. Builds run only in GitHub Actions; release artifacts are GitHub Releases for the frontends and GHCR for the image (`ghcr.io/yskaa91/matrix_synapse:<version>`).

Frontend fork features live under `src/swag/` in Element Call and as the theme asset in Element Web, with anchors recorded in `src/swag/anchors.md`. `webapp_source: upstream` or the pin options roll back to the originals without rebuilding the image.

Dependencies are split by when they enter the system:

| When | Dependency | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Image build | Debian base, Python venv, `matrix-synapse[all]>=1.162.0`, `psycopg2-binary`, `pyOpenSSL`, PostgreSQL 15, build tools, s6-overlay files | `Dockerfile` |
| Container start | Element Web, Element Call, Ketesa webapps; LiveKit server; lk-jwt-service | GitHub Releases downloaded by `cont-init.d/03-download-binaries.sh` and `05-download-webapps.sh` |
| Selected by `webapp_source` | Element Web / Element Call | `Yskaa91/*` forks by default, `element-hq/*` for `upstream` or fallback |
| Always upstream | Ketesa admin UI | `etkecc/ketesa` |
| Always upstream | LiveKit SFU and JWT bridge | `livekit/livekit`, `element-hq/lk-jwt-service` |
| Bundled in Element Call swag releases | Theme assets, Reactions soundboard sounds, GTCRN vendored assets, DeepFilterNet3 WASM/model/worklet | Inside the Element Call tarball; no separate runtime download |

The DeepFilterNet3 denoiser is not an add-on dependency: `@workadventure/noise-suppression@0.2.0` is bundled into the Element Call swag build, and only its `/deepfilternet` entrypoint is imported lazily. After every Element Call update the add-on syncs the Element Call widget copy under Element Web.

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1 — Add the repository

```text
Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Repositories
```

Add this fork:

```text
https://github.com/yskaa91/ha-apps
```

The upstream repository remains `https://github.com/pol4rfuchs/ha-apps`; this fork is the one that serves the swag frontend builds by default.

### Step 2 — Install & configure

Install **Matrix Server (ESS CE)** and set at minimum:

```yaml
server_name: "example.org"
element_web_url: "https://example.org"
postgres_password: "changeme_please"
enable_registration: false
```

### Step 3 — Start

First start takes 2–3 minutes. Element Web and Ketesa are downloaded at runtime (HA blocks network during the Docker build phase).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `server_name` | — | Your Matrix domain. **No trailing slash.** |
| `element_web_url` | — | External HTTPS URL for Element Web. |
| `postgres_password` | — | PostgreSQL password — set before first start. |
| `enable_registration` | `false` | Allow public registration. |
| `enable_federation` | `true` | Connect to the Matrix federation. |
| `max_upload_size_mb` | `50` | Max media upload size in MB. |
| `log_level` | `WARNING` | `DEBUG / INFO / WARNING / ERROR` |
| `ntfy_url` | — | Optional: external ntfy URL for UnifiedPush. |
| `enable_voice_calls` | `false` | Enable Element Call (MSC3401) with LiveKit SFU. Downloads LiveKit and lk-jwt-service on first start. |
| `livekit_secret` | — | Shared secret for LiveKit. Leave empty to auto-generate on first start (stored in `/data/matrix/.livekit_secret`). |
| `element_call_url` | — | External HTTPS URL for Element Call. Only used if `enable_voice_calls` is `true`. |
| `livekit_url` | — | WebSocket URL for LiveKit SFU (`wss://...`). Only used if `enable_voice_calls` is `true`. |
| `livekit_jwt_url` | — | HTTPS URL for the LiveKit JWT bridge. Only used if `enable_voice_calls` is `true`. |
| `webapp_source` | `swag` | Where Element Web and Element Call come from: `swag` = release tags of the Yskaa91 forks (needed for the Discord-like voice features), `upstream` = `element-hq/*` originals. Ketesa always comes from upstream. |
| `element_web_pin_version` | `auto` | `auto` = newest release of the selected source; a tag (e.g. `v1.12.30-swag.1`) = exactly that Element Web release. Rollback knob for a bad Element Web build. A tag that does not exist is treated as a download failure: the add-on falls back to upstream for this start and does not record a version. |
| `element_call_pin_version` | `auto` | Same, for Element Call (e.g. `v0.26.1-swag.1`). Separate option because the two forks tag in different namespaces — one shared pin would be wrong for the other component. |

> ⚠️ `server_name` cannot be changed after the first start — it becomes the permanent Matrix ID (`@user:server_name`).

## 🌐 Ports

| Port | Service | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `7080` | Element Web | Via NPM → `element.your-domain` |
| `7081` | Element Call | Via NPM → `element-call.your-domain` |
| `8008` | Synapse API | Via NPM → `matrix.your-domain` |
| `8090` | Ketesa (Admin UI) | Via NPM → `admin.your-domain` |
| `8448` | Matrix Federation | Direct — port-forward required |
| `7880` | LiveKit SFU | Via NPM (WebSocket required) |
| `8089` | LiveKit JWT Bridge | Via NPM |
| `3478/udp` | TURN (media control) | **Direct — port-forward required, cannot go via NPM** |
| `5349/tcp` | TURN TLS fallback | Direct — port-forward required (only needed for strict corporate firewalls) |
| `30000-30020/udp` | TURN Relay Range (media) | **Direct — port-forward required, cannot go via NPM** |

> ⚠️ The three TURN/relay rows are the most commonly missed step in setup — most guides only mention Federation as needing a direct router forward. Without UDP 3478 and the 30000-30020 relay range forwarded, calls will connect (signaling works fine over NPM) but carry no audio or video at all — even between two devices on the same LAN, since LiveKit always routes media through its built-in TURN server by design. The relay range is intentionally kept to 21 ports rather than LiveKit's 10,000-port default; see `NPM_SETUP.md` for why.

See [`NPM_SETUP.md`](NPM_SETUP.md) for the full Nginx Proxy Manager configuration.

## 👤 Creating the first admin user

```bash
docker exec -it addon_local_matrix_server \
  /opt/synapse/bin/register_new_matrix_user \
  -c /data/matrix/synapse/homeserver.yaml \
  --admin -u admin -p YourSecurePassword \
  http://localhost:8008
```

Or use the helper script included in the add-on:

```bash
docker exec -it addon_local_matrix_server matrix-create-admin.sh
```

> ℹ️ This creates a **new** admin user. To promote an existing user to admin instead, update the database directly:
> ```bash
> docker exec -it addon_local_matrix_server \
>   gosu postgres psql -d synapse -c "UPDATE users SET admin = 1 WHERE name = '@username:example.org';"
> ```
> Log out and back in afterwards — an already-active session won't pick up the change automatically.

└── .registration_secret            ← Auto-generated registration_shared_secret
```

Element Web, Ketesa, Element Call, and (if voice is enabled) the LiveKit/lk-jwt-service binaries each compare their installed version against the selected source's `latest` on every add-on start and re-download automatically on mismatch — no manual action needed. Ketesa, LiveKit and lk-jwt-service are always upstream; Element Web and Element Call follow `webapp_source` and their pins.

To force a re-download of a specific component (e.g. after a corrupted extraction):

```bash
docker exec addon_local_matrix_server rm /data/matrix/.ketesa_version
# then restart the add-on — it will detect the missing version file and re-fetch
```

## 📱 UnifiedPush (Android push via ntfy)

This add-on integrates with the [ntfy add-on](../ntfy) for privacy-friendly push notifications on Element Android — no Google Firebase, no external servers.

```
Element Android
  → selects ntfy as UnifiedPush distributor
  → registers push gateway with Synapse:
      https://ntfy.your-domain/_matrix/push/v1/notify
  → Synapse sends pushes to ntfy
  → ntfy delivers to your device
```

Synapse does not need the ntfy URL in its config — the client registers the gateway automatically.

**Setup:**
1. Set `ntfy_url` in the add-on config
2. Install ntfy from F-Droid (Play Store version has no UnifiedPush)
3. In Element Android: Settings → Notifications → UnifiedPush → select ntfy

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Server name has invalid format` | Trailing slash in `server_name` | Remove the slash |
| Admin Panel "Something went wrong" | Stale browser cache | F12 → Application → Clear Site Data |
| Admin Panel 401 | NPM Access List active | Set Access List to "Publicly Accessible" |
| Element Web wrong server | Wrong config.json loaded | Clear browser cache |
| Web apps not loading | Extraction failed | Delete the relevant `.{app}_version` file in `/data/matrix/` + restart add-on |
| Synapse token invalid | Add-on reinstalled, DB empty | Re-create admin user |
| Federation broken | Port 8448 not forwarded | Router: 8448 → HA-IP:8448 |
| Call connects but no audio/video | TURN UDP 3478 and/or the relay range 30000-30020 not forwarded on the router | Forward both directly (not via NPM) to the HA host. Needed even for calls between devices on the same LAN, since LiveKit always routes media through TURN. |
| Login stuck loading / blank screen via `http://<LAN-IP>:7080` | Plain HTTP has no "secure context" — browsers disable WebCrypto (needed for E2E encryption) on anything that isn't HTTPS or `localhost` | Use the HTTPS domain (e.g. `https://element.your-domain`) instead, even from the LAN — most routers support NAT hairpinning so this works without leaving the network. Direct `:7080` IP access is a convenience fallback only and won't fully work by design. |
