# Unbound — Advanced Documentation

This document covers persistent data, backup, and advanced configuration
details beyond the installation/quickstart steps in the README.

## Persistent Data

All runtime configuration lives in `/data/config.json`, managed exclusively
through the add-on's web UI. This includes:

- Blocklists, whitelist entries, local DNS records
- Server settings (network, performance, cache, security tabs)
- Query log data

`/data` is the add-on's own persistent storage and survives add-on
restarts, updates, and container recreation automatically — no extra `map:`
entry is required for it.

## Backup

Back up `/data/config.json` if you want to restore your DNS configuration
(blocklists, local records, server settings) onto a fresh install. A
Home Assistant full backup (which includes add-on data by default) already
covers this — no addon-specific backup hooks are configured.

There are no secrets to manage for this add-on: Unbound itself doesn't
require credentials, and the web UI has no separate authentication beyond
what Ingress/HA already provides.

## Custom `unbound.conf` and Overlay Files

See the README's "Custom Configuration" and "Overlay Files" sections for the
full mechanism (`unbound-overlay.conf` / `unbound-extra.conf` under
`/addon_configs/<slug>_unbound/`). In short:

- **Full custom config**: enable "Custom Config" in the web UI, then place a
  complete `unbound.conf` at the addon config path. When enabled, all GUI
  settings are ignored.
- **Overlay files**: keep GUI-managed settings but inject a few extra
  `server:` directives or whole top-level sections (`auth-zone:`, `view:`)
  that the GUI doesn't expose.

If the combined configuration fails `unbound-checkconf` validation, the
add-on automatically falls back to GUI-only settings and surfaces the
validation error in the **Advanced** tab, so a bad snippet never takes DNS
resolution down.

## Log Level

The only option exposed in the HA add-on panel (`log_level`) controls the
verbosity of the add-on's own supervisor process log — it does not affect
what's recorded in the web UI's query log, which is controlled separately
via the **Logging** section in the web UI's Server Settings.

## Local and external access

**Local (LAN):** DNS listens on `5053` (tcp/udp). Point your router, AdGuard upstream or clients at `<ha-host>:5053`. The web UI is Ingress-only (port 2137 is not mapped) and relies on the Home Assistant login; it has no login of its own, so the app rejects every request that does not come from the Ingress gateway. By default only private networks may query the resolver (access control).

**External (internet):** **never forward `5053`.** An open resolver can be abused for DNS amplification attacks. If your router can only forward port 53, use a NAT redirect inside the LAN only.
