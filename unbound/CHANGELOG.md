# Changelog

## [1.26.1-ha2-pol4r1] - 2026-10-11

- Security: the web UI now rejects every request that does not come from the Home Assistant Ingress gateway (`172.30.32.2`) or loopback. The UI has no login of its own, so before this other containers on the add-on network could reach it directly.


## [1.26.1-ha1-pol4r1] - 2026-09-24

- Bump Unbound to 1.26.1 (automated by Renovate PR #412, checksum-verified against NLnetLabs' published sha256).


## [1.26.0-ha1-pol4r1] - 2026-08-06

- Bump Unbound 1.25.2 → 1.26.0 (upstream feature + bugfix release, no
  additional CVEs since 1.25.2). Notable upstream changes: new
  `block_aaaa` / `block_a_wdata` / `block_aaaa_wdata` local-zone types,
  `max-transfer-size`/`max-transfer-time` hardening for auth-zone/RPZ
  transfers, and a heap out-of-bounds write fix in `outside_network_create()`.
- No add-on config schema or Dockerfile build-flag changes required for
  this bump; checksum verification against NLnetLabs' published
  sha256 remains automatic at build time.


## 1.25.1-ha8-pol4r1

- Fix: AppArmor profile blocked bashio's default `mktemp` temp files
  (`/tmp/tmp.*`), causing `cannot create temp file for here-document:
  Permission denied` in `jq.sh` on container restart and leaving the
  startup banner's app name/version blank. Added explicit allow rule
  for bashio's default mktemp naming pattern.

## [1.25.1-ha7-pol4r1] - 2026-06-28

- Verify the Unbound source tarball against NLnet Labs' official
  sha256 checksum before building (supply-chain hardening for the
  source build introduced in ha1).
- Replace world-writable (umask 000) query log creation with a
  group-owned, mode-0660 file. Root joins the `unbound` group at
  build time so app.py can still write/clear the log without needing
  CAP_CHOWN at runtime — closes an undocumented exception to our own
  "no chmod 666" baseline in SECURITY.md.
- Add `harden-algo-downgrade` and `harden-below-nxdomain` to the
  generated unbound.conf. The latter is config-level defense-in-depth
  for the ghost-domain CVE class (CVE-2026-40622) fixed in the 1.25.1
  binary.
- AppArmor: drop the unused `sys_chroot` capability (chroot is
  disabled), and restrict `/etc/unbound/**` to owner-only write so
  the privilege-dropped daemon can no longer modify its own config.
- Give `run.sh`'s two `mktemp` calls explicit templates matching the
  AppArmor `/tmp/unbound-*` glob, instead of relying on the bare
  `/tmp/ rw` rule for unmatched default mktemp filenames.

## [1.25.1-ha6-pol4r1] - 2026-06-28

- Verify the Unbound source tarball against NLnet Labs' official
  sha256 checksum before building (supply-chain hardening for the
  source-build introduced in ha1).
- Replace world-writable (umask 000) query log creation with a
  group-owned, mode-0660 file — closes an undocumented exception to
  our own "no chmod 666" baseline.
- Add `harden-algo-downgrade` and `harden-below-nxdomain` to the
  generated unbound.conf. The latter is config-level defense-in-depth
  for the ghost-domain CVE class (CVE-2026-40622) fixed in the 1.25.1
  binary.
- AppArmor: drop the unused `sys_chroot` capability (chroot is
  disabled), and restrict `/etc/unbound/**` to owner-only write so
  the privilege-dropped daemon can no longer modify its own config.
- Give `run.sh`'s two `mktemp` calls explicit templates matching the
  AppArmor `/tmp/unbound-*` glob, instead of relying on the bare
  `/tmp/ rw` rule for unmatched default mktemp filenames.

## [1.25.1-ha5-pol4r1] - 2026-06-28

- Cosmetic: disable Unbound's pidfile entirely (`--with-pidfile=""`).
  It was written before the privilege drop to `unbound`, and the
  container's missing CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE made that fail with
  "Permission denied" — non-fatal (Unbound started fine regardless),
  but noisy. Not needed under s6 process supervision anyway.

## [1.25.1-ha4-pol4r1] - 2026-06-28

- Fix Unbound startup crash from the ha3 fix attempt: runtime `chown` on
  `/var/run/unbound` failed with "Operation not permitted" — the
  container lacks `CAP_CHOWN` at runtime (same AppArmor capability gap
  as the original root.key fix). Switched Unbound's pidfile/run-dir to
  `/var/lib/unbound` instead, which is already proven to keep its
  ownership across restarts without needing any runtime chown.

## [1.25.1-ha3-pol4r1] - 2026-06-28

- Fix Unbound startup crash: `cannot open pidfile ... Permission denied` /
  `Could not chdir to /var/run/unbound: Permission denied`. s6-overlay
  resets `/run` fresh on every container start, so the build-time
  chown/chmod on `/var/run/unbound` never survived into the running
  container. Now recreated and chowned at the top of `run.sh` on
  every start.

## [1.25.1-ha2-pol4r1] - 2026-06-28

- No functional change — re-tag to force Supervisor to detect an update.
  The 1.25.1-ha1-pol4r1 image was rebuilt after a Dockerfile fix
  (multi-stage ARG/FROM ordering, see commit fixing the
  "base name (${BUILD_FROM}) should not be blank" build failure),
  but Supervisor compares version strings, not image digests, so the
  unchanged version number never surfaced as an available update.
  
## [1.25.1-ha1-pol4r1] - 2026-06-27

- Rebase on Alpine 3.24 (hassio-addons/base v20.2.0) and bump Unbound 1.24.2 → 1.25.1
- Security release upstream: 11 CVEs fixed, including a remote-code-execution risk in DNSSEC validation (CVE-2026-33278), cache-poisoning fixes, several crash fixes, and a mitigation for the "Jiggle Attack"
- No add-on config schema changes — existing settings keep working as-is

## [1.24.2-ha39-pol4r1] (2026-06-27)

### Bug Fixes

* **unbound:** drop privileges to unbound user to prevent root.key permission crash ([8a11628](https://github.com/pol4rfuchs/ha-apps/commit/8a11628880d1d33f9bf8812d0bb55b6987447646))

## [1.24.2-ha38] - 2026/05/23

- Fix DNS-over-TLS forwarding: emit `tls-cert-bundle: "/etc/ssl/cert.pem"` when forward TLS is enabled so upstream certs validate against the system CA store — without this, every DoT handshake failed with "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" (issue #19)
- Pin `ca-certificates-bundle` explicitly in the image so the bundle is guaranteed present regardless of openssl's transitive deps

## [1.24.2-ha37] - 2026/05/22

- Add overlay-file mode: when the standard custom-config toggle is off, the addon now picks up `/config/unbound-overlay.conf` (injected at the end of the generated `server:` block) and `/config/unbound-extra.conf` (appended after `server:` for full top-level sections like `auth-zone:` / `view:` / `forward-zone:`) — closes issues #10 and #11
- Overlay files are opt-in by presence; existing users with `custom_config: false` or `true` are unaffected unless they drop one of the new filenames
- If `unbound-checkconf` rejects the combined config, the addon retries without overlays, logs a warning, and surfaces the error in the Advanced tab so DNS stays up while the snippet is fixed
- Boot order updated: blocklist/local-records init now happens before config generation so the validator sees all include targets
- Web UI: added an "Overlay Files" section in the Advanced tab with file-presence status and a fallback banner

## [1.24.2-ha36] - 2026/05/22

- Add EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) toggle in Security & Privacy tab (issue #18)
- When enabled, the `subnetcache` module is loaded ahead of `validator`/`iterator` and ECS is forwarded for all zones (`client-subnet-zone: "."`) with privacy-preserving defaults: IPv4 truncated to /24, IPv6 to /56
- Note: unbound stays on 1.24.2 from Alpine 3.23; upstream 1.25.1 will land once it reaches the stable Alpine branch

## [1.24.2-ha35] - 2026/05/03

- Fix Query Log tab showing garbage rows from non-query `info:` lines (issue #17)
- Tighten log parser: validate client as IPv4/IPv6, require trailing dot on domain, restrict class to IN/CH/HS/ANY/NONE
- Split `log-replies` into its own setting; previously it was forced on whenever `log_queries` was enabled, causing every lookup to appear twice
- Add "Clear Log" button in Query Log tab (POST `/api/query-log/clear`)

## [1.24.2-ha34] - 2026/04/30

- Diagnostics for "SSL handshake failed" on Save & Apply (issue #13)
- Surface stderr from `unbound-control` in error messages so OpenSSL/TLS details are no longer dropped
- Retry `unbound-control reload` once on transient failures to cover control-channel races

## [1.24.2-ha33] - 2026/04/29

- Fix dashboard showing "0" prefetches and "N/A" threads in multi-threaded mode (issue #16)
- Read prefetch counter from `total.num.prefetch` instead of non-existent `num.prefetch`
- Derive thread count by counting `threadX.num.queries` keys since unbound does not emit `num.threads`

## [1.24.2-ha32] - 2026/04/20

- Fix "Permission denied" crash on startup caused by runtime chown/chmod failing in HA containers
- Fix autotrust file (`/var/lib/unbound/root.key`) permission denied (issue #14)
- Fix query log permission denied in custom config mode (issue #7)
- Set world-writable permissions on `/var/lib/unbound` at build time instead of runtime
- Use umask trick for query log creation to avoid needing CAP_CHOWN

### Recovery guide (if stuck on ha29-ha31)

If your addon crashes on startup with `chown: Permission denied` or `chmod: Permission denied`
and you can't update because DNS is down, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Patch the broken container to get DNS back
DOCKER_ID=$(docker ps -a --filter "name=unbound" --format "{{.ID}}")
docker cp $DOCKER_ID:/run.sh /tmp/run.sh
sed -i '/chown/d;/chmod/d' /tmp/run.sh
docker cp /tmp/run.sh $DOCKER_ID:/run.sh
docker commit $DOCKER_ID ghcr.io/fenio/unbound-amd64:1.24.2-ha31
ha apps restart 6a5ae1ea_unbound

# 2. Temporarily switch DNS so HA supervisor sees internet connectivity
#    (replace address/gateway with your actual values)
ha network update enp1s0 --ipv4-method static --ipv4-address 192.0.2.200/24 --ipv4-gateway 192.0.2.1 --ipv4-nameserver 8.8.8.8

# 3. Wait for supervisor to detect connectivity, then update
sleep 30
ha supervisor repair
ha apps update 6a5ae1ea_unbound

# 4. Revert DNS back to unbound
ha network update enp1s0 --ipv4-method static --ipv4-address 192.0.2.200/24 --ipv4-gateway 192.0.2.1 --ipv4-nameserver 192.0.2.200
```

Note: Replace `amd64` with `aarch64` if on ARM (e.g., Raspberry Pi). Replace the IP
address, gateway, and addon slug with your actual values.
